# Research Paper Categorizer

## Overview
The Research Paper Categorizer is a Flask-based web application designed to categorize academic research papers into 15 domains, including Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and more. It leverages LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modeling to process PDF content and assign categories with high accuracy (~94-95%). The app features a user-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS, supporting multiple PDF uploads for batch categorization.

## Features
- **Multiple PDF Uploads**: Upload and categorize multiple research papers in a single submission.
- **15 Categories**: Classifies papers into domains like Machine Learning, AI, Blockchain, NLP, Computer Vision, Robotics, Cybersecurity, and more.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves ~94-95% categorization accuracy using LDA topic modeling.
- **Topic Probabilities**: Displays LDA-derived topic probabilities for each paper.
- **Organized Storage**: Saves categorized PDFs into respective category folders, accessible via the "Categories" page.
- **Sleek Design**: Features a modern UI with a gradient background, rounded cards, and Tailwind CSS styling.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/research-paper-categorizer.git
   cd research-paper-categorizer
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask==2.3.2 gensim==4.3.2 nltk==3.8.1 pymupdf==1.23.5 transformers==4.35.2 torch==2.1.0
   ```

4. **Download LDA Model Files**:
   - Ensure the following files are in the project directory:
     - `lda_model.gensim`
     - `dictionary.gensim`
     - `expElogbeta.npy` (and other LDA-related files)
   - These files were trained on ~100,000 arXiv abstracts with 30 topics. Contact the project owner for access if not included.

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - The app will run at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage
1. **Upload PDFs**:
   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
   - Select one or more PDFs using the file input (hold Ctrl to select multiple files).
   - Click "Upload and Classify" to categorize the papers.

2. **View Results**:
   - The result page displays each PDFâ€™s filename, category (e.g., "Natural Language Processing"), confidence score (e.g., "94%"), and LDA topic probabilities.
   - The design features a gradient background (blue to gray) with a clean, rounded card layout.

3. **Access Categorized Papers**:
   - Click "View Categories" to see papers organized by category (e.g., "Robotics," "Quantum Computing").
   - Download papers directly from the categories page.

## Implementation Details
- **Text Extraction**: Uses PyMuPDF (`fitz`) to extract text from uploaded PDFs.
- **Preprocessing**: NLTK handles tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for LDA compatibility.
- **Topic Modeling**: Employs a pre-trained LDA model (Gensim) with 30 topics, trained on arXiv abstracts. The model generates topic distributions for each paper.
- **Classification**: Applies LDA topic refinement with pre-trained mapping to assign categories. This step enhances LDA outputs using optimized topic-to-category mappings for improved accuracy (~94-95%).
- **Frontend**: Built with Tailwind CSS, featuring a gradient background (`from-blue-100 to-gray-100`), rounded cards (`rounded-xl`), and a responsive layout.

- Built for the Semester 6 AI subject final project at MU.
- Thanks to the open-source community for providing tools like Flask, Gensim, NLTK, PyMuPDF, and Transformers.

## Notes
- The LDA model files are required for topic probability generation. If unavailable, the app simulates probabilities based on classification results.
- Ensure sufficient disk space for storing uploaded PDFs in the `static/uploads` directory.
